<h1>Nuri Bae</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Nuri Bae, and I'm technically a third-year MSI student in the Big Data Analytics track. I'm taking it slow as a part-time student. By day, I'm a data science analyst in the healthcare data field, where I mainly focus on machine learning and natural language processing projects. But, I'm also really passionate about data visualization because it's such a powerful tool for sharing insights with others. Before diving into data science, I studied architecture, where my research focused on building energy analysis and understanding people's comfort in built environments.</p>
